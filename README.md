This repository describes image analysis from the paper Lawlor, Vanslambrouck, Higgins et al, Nature Materials, 2020.

Raw image data is available from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12957122.v1

Code and directions for recreating the analysis in the paper are contained in the notebook scRNA-imaging-analysis.ipynb

Note, in some cases informal names are used to describe the ratio notation in the paper : 'dots' refers to R0 (single point deposition 'dot' organoids), 'line' refers to R40 thin conformation organoids and 'hand' refers to manually generated organoids.
